# Devops-Journey
I am documenting my devops journey so that may other can benefit from it.
I am going to dedicate 1 hour every day to learn new technologies and understand how a day in life of devops engineer looks like.
1) a programming language----Python (most popular), node js and ruby.
Some say to learn Golang.
2) Linux basics- Linux commands and shell scripting
3) Networking fundamentals: DNS, subnetting, gateways, DHCP, NAT, OSI Model, firewalls, load balancers, proxy servers, and HTTP/HTTPS.
4) Pick one cloud provider. Aws,Azure or Google cloud
5) Use Git effectively, along with creating repositories on github
6) Containers- Docker: Containers allow for a consistent and portable environment for applications to run on. When it comes to learning Docker, make sure to get hands-on experience. This is super easy to do as pretty much anything can run Docker. 
You’ll want to be able to create, run, download, change, and inspect containers. It’s also important that you understand the networking stack, storage management, and the creation of your own Dockerfiles.
7)Orchestration tools:Kubernetes
8)Infrastructure as a code: Terraform is a great tool for learning infrastructure as code. Terraform allows for you to write, plan, and apply desired state changes to your infrastructure for multiple providers. Terraform understands the current state of your deployment and retains it for you.You find yourself needing to deploy virtual machines multiple times in different locations. Terraform and other IaC tools make this a breeze. 
9)Automate Configuration Management:Tools such as Ansible, Puppet and Chef provide a simple way to automate your configuration management.
10) Create CI/CD Pipelines:Continuous Integration: If you have been scratching the surface of DevOps, you’ll have most likely come across the terms Code > Build > Test. This process is the foundation of getting application code tested and ready to release to your audience.
Continuous Deployment/Delivery: Continuous Deployment/Delivery will enable you to update your application in an automated fashion. If the code passes its tests, use continuous deployment to push that code into the next environment be it, QA, staging, or production. 
tools for creating CI/CD pipelines are: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, TravisCI, and GitLab.
11)Monitoring, Log Management and Data Visualization:Many of the tools discussed here ensure proper configuration with security in mind, but the integrity of your applications is your responsibility. You should make certain that your application is secure before pushing it to production.It’s also important to consider how your systems collect and aggregate data. Finding a way to visualize the information you collect can be extremely useful when analyzing trends and to mitigate risk. Tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) should be on your radar while you’re trying to understand this area of DevOps.
12)At some point in your journey, you are going to require a level of stateful data, be it some sort of persistent storage for storing logs or an actual database requirement. This is where data management comes in. You’ll need to know where to store the dataset, as well as how to best protect the data. There are a host of different database options to explore. I’d advise you to learn the fundamentals of backing up data, managing application mobility between environments, and disaster recovery.
